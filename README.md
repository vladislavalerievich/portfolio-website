# Django-personal-website

This is a Django-based personal website I created for myself. The current theme from my previous portfolio website.
I am releasing the full source code for the site so that others may benefit from the code I've written.
Live example is [here](https://vlad-moroshan.herokuapp.com)

# Installation and Running

* change into the new directory
* Run the command `python manage.py runserver`
* Open your web browser and enter the adress of your local server (usually its http://127.0.0.1:8000 )
